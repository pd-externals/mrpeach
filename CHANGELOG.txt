	* [r15093] [routeOSC] now handles incoming messages that are not
	  valid OSC messages as though they were messages with the OSC path
	  /, so that [routeOSC]s may be cascaded, with the / argument used
	  to select messages whose path matched the previous level.

2011-03-26 02:02  mrpeach

	* [r14737] Added a HEAD method.

2011-01-13 19:19  mrpeach

	* [r14736] Sometimes send returns 0 if the packet is queued, so we
	  don't consider that to mean it's blocked.

2011-01-13 18:54  mrpeach

	* [r14735] Two externals to process HTTP/1.1 requests and responses
	  in conjunction with net exernals like [tcpclient] or
	  [slipenc]/[slipdec]. So far only GET requests work.

2010-12-16 05:35  mrpeach

	* [r14663] Fixed problems when bundle depth is exceeded. Placed
	  global defines in packingOSC.h. Thanks to zmoelnig for pointing
	  this out in tracker id 3136648.

2010-12-11 20:43  mrpeach

	* [r14590] Fixed bug in record where running status was not
	  implemented properly. Now running status is not used, to
	  facilitate looping the file.
	  Changed help patch to implement real MIDI input from hardware.

2010-11-28 18:19  mrpeach

	* [r14534] changed #ifdef for
	  #define snprintf sprintf_s
	  to _MSC_VER so MinGW doesn't see it.

	* [r14473] include ifaddrs.h for mac, for getifaddrs() and
	  freeifaddrs()

2010-11-03 21:37  mrpeach

	  architectures.

2010-10-29 17:32  mrpeach

	* [r14247] Cleaned up unused code.

	  list inputs.

2010-09-08 20:56  mrpeach

	* [r14002] Cleaned out some useless post statements. Removed
	  sys_lock and sys_unlock since they would freeze everything if
	  nothing was found. If an
	  object is an internal, it still won't be found by [which] since
	  we don't seem to have access to that list.

2010-08-26 20:30  mrpeach

	* [r13945] Applied zmoelnig's patch 3051663 to handle intermixed

	* [r13755] Fixed bugs in _WIN32 socket error reporting.

2010-08-04 17:18  mrpeach

	  udpsend_sock_err function to print system errors in the pd
	  console instead of stderr.

2010-08-03 03:46  mrpeach

	* [r13741] Can set_multicast_interface on _WIN32 now.

	* [r13737] Added method to set multicast TTL, updated help patch.

2010-08-02 15:37  mrpeach

	* [r13736] set_multicast_interface doesn't work in _WIN32 yet so I
	  just post a message.

2010-07-30 19:09  mrpeach

	* [r13734] Added method to select interface when multicasting,
	  updated help patch.

2010-07-18 23:24  mrpeach

	* [r13723] Fix ip_mreq stuff for MACOSX and _WIN32 (we hope...)

2010-07-16 21:30  mrpeach

	* [r13694] converted error() calls to pd_error() calls where
	  appropriate, ie. where a findable error is desirable

2010-06-14 20:38  mrpeach

	* [r13565] Cleaned up some diagnostic messages.

2010-05-19 20:45  mrpeach

	* [r13564] Trying to make it immune to garbage input: Don't attempt
	  to print bad OSC path, it could cause trouble.

2010-05-13 19:35  mrpeach

2010-05-13 19:33  mrpeach

	* [r13532] Check for buffer overflow when adding individual floats.
	  Also it should be possible to interleave floats and lists, but
	  there are
	  probably bugs in that bit...

2010-05-08 19:01  mrpeach

	* [r13510] Incorporated ico's patch for threaded broadcasting.

2010-05-06 04:51  mrpeach

	  assuming they were encoded using SLIP. Useful for OSC over serial
	  links.

2010-05-03 23:23  mrpeach

	* [r13487] slipenc encodes an input list of bytes-as-floats with

	  timing scheme like the 555 timer IC.
	  

2010-03-29 17:29  zmoelnig

	* [r13306] oops, undoing last commit; sorry

2010-03-29 17:26  zmoelnig

	* [r13305] replaced &s_... by gensym("...")

2010-03-27 15:58  mrpeach

	* [r13292] Added output of IP address of disconnecting client at
	  suggestion of Ivica Ico Bukvic ico@vt.edu.
	  Removed send timeout message since each send is in its own thread
	  and won't cause trouble if it hangs...

2010-03-26 18:41  mrpeach

	* [r13290] Sends all bytes in one block in a single thread, blocks
	  further sends if one doesn't work until [unblock( message
	  received.
	  Removed [receive(, [recv(, [timeout( message methods as they are
	  not relevant.

2010-03-24 15:46  mrpeach

	* [r13253] Added a flag that is set if sender thread can't create.
	  This stops any further sends until an [unblock( message is sent
	  to tcpserver.

2010-03-23 21:11  mrpeach

	* [r13248] signal/float operators like [>=~] from zexy but operator
	  can be reconfigured on the fly.

2010-03-23 21:08  mrpeach

	* [r13247] Made all functions except rc_tilde_setup() static.

2010-03-23 16:13  mrpeach

	  tcpclient_free if verbosity==1.

2010-03-22 20:12  mrpeach

	* [r13239] Changed valid-stream output to be a signal output. Moved

	  patch.

2010-03-15 21:24  mrpeach

	* [r13207] An external that emulates an RC timer, similar to lop~
	  but good for envelope generation.

2010-03-11 21:04  mrpeach

	* [r13205] Updfated version number and help patch.

2010-03-11 19:28  mrpeach

	* [r13204] Added a "TAG!" identifier field to the tag so it can be
	  verified as a tag. This should help prevent crashes in case of
	  dropped packets.

2010-03-09 17:31  mrpeach

	* [r13199] Moved client-specific parameters into a single
	  t_tcpserver_socketreceiver struct.

2010-03-09 10:28  zmoelnig

	* [r13197] fixing bug #2966186

2010-03-02 17:44  mrpeach

	* [r13193] Added a verbosity method to stop [tcpclient] printing in
	  the main window every time it connects/disconnects.
	  Updated the help patch to match.

2010-02-24 18:37  mrpeach

	* [r13189] Corrected some error messages, check for EINVAL after
	  recvfrom(), to try to find out why it happens...

2010-01-25 14:40  zmoelnig

	* [r13088] install reference files side-by-side with the object
	  files

2010-01-20 19:41  mrpeach

	* [r13057] Added SO_BROADCAST so you can actually broadcast with a
	  .255 address...

2010-01-18 17:41  mrpeach

	* [r13038] use unix line endings

2010-01-18 17:25  mrpeach

	* [r13037] Make the connection thread detached and don't refer to
	  its struct directly, check for thread
	  creation errors.

2010-01-18 04:31  mrpeach

	* [r13031] Use NULL instead of 0 to reset thread pointer so maybe
	  now MinGW can compile it...removed unused symbols

2010-01-15 18:53  mrpeach

	* [r13013] Added include for ws2tcpip.h for socklen_t for _WIN32

2010-01-14 20:26  mrpeach

	* [r12999] Don't need float_cast.h anymore, using the flint union
	  with ntohl/htonl instead.

2010-01-14 20:24  mrpeach

	* [r12998] Always send in network byte order for all architectures.
	  UDP receiving socket doesn't need to be
	  non-blocking (I think...). Cleaned up help patch.

2010-01-14 20:21  mrpeach

	* [r12997] Changed int optLen to socklen_t to avoid signedness
	  warning

2010-01-13 21:54  mrpeach

	* [r12985] Fixed header files for _WIN32

2010-01-12 18:58  mrpeach

	* [r12968] Block size is settable by creation argument. Buffer size
	  message is specified in frames. Info message gives some more
	  info. Channels
	  transmitted can be set to zero. Cleaned up help patch.

2010-01-11 16:56  mrpeach

	* [r12955] Added "unix" to the test for "UNIX".

2010-01-11 14:27  mrpeach

	* [r12954] help patch for udpsend~ and udpreceive~

2010-01-11 14:25  mrpeach

	* [r12953] Versions of netsend~ for udp.

2010-01-04 16:49  mrpeach

	* [r12882] Had the wrong #include for ioctl...

2010-01-02 20:50  mrpeach

	* [r12874] Changed MSW to _WIN32. Added
	  tcpserver_send_buffer_avaliable_for_client()
	  using SIOCOUTQ ioctl in linux to see if send buffer has any room
	  left. Apparently no equivalent exists for BSD or Windows.

2010-01-02 20:22  mrpeach

	* [r12873] Cleaned up a bit...

2010-01-02 20:19  mrpeach

	* [r12872] Changed MSW to _WIN32

2010-01-02 20:17  mrpeach

	* [r12871] Changed MSW to _WIN32

2010-01-02 20:11  mrpeach

	* [r12870] Changed MSW to _WIN32

2010-01-02 20:09  mrpeach

2010-01-02 20:04  mrpeach

	* [r12867] Changed MSW to _WIN32

2010-01-02 20:03  mrpeach

	* [r12866] Changed MSW to _WIN32

2010-01-02 19:59  mrpeach

	* [r12865] Changed MSW to _WIN32

2010-01-02 19:52  mrpeach

2010-01-02 19:51  mrpeach

	* [r12863] Changed MSW to _WIN32

2009-12-27 03:09  mrpeach

	* [r12845] include math.h for log()

2009-12-13 23:34  matju

	* [r12834] fixed two 64-bit bugs because int!=long

2009-12-13 23:33  matju

	* [r12833] resolved 1 slight 64-bit bug because int!=long and 5
	  spurious warnings because long!=size_t

2009-12-13 23:27  matju

	* [r12832] added by request from two independent people at once

2009-11-29 17:37  mrpeach

	* [r12814] Sender threads are now created in the detached state so
	  their resources will be freed when the threads complete. This
	  appears to stop the accumulation of handles on WinXP at least.

2009-11-28 21:38  mrpeach

	* [r12813] Removed duplicate send, added threaded send for files,
	  and also send whenever buffer is full (65536 bytes) for incoming
	  lists (although [tcpserver] is unlikely to be fed lists that
	  long)

2009-11-12 22:16  mrpeach

	* [r12760] Using pthreads to send each message to each client in
	  its own thread. This should eliminate hangups when clients
	  disappear halfway through, and increase responsiveness of Pd with
	  [tcpserver]. Messages are sent as one unit instead of
	  byte-by-byte. Select() is no longer used to check for available
	  space in the buffer.

2009-07-23 22:15  mrpeach

	* [r11879] Outputs a bang via bang outlet when done, same as
	  [textfile]. No more bangs through bin outlet.

2009-07-09 15:41  mrpeach

	* [r11853] Changed midifile playback to print status instead of
	  playing it.
	  (thanks Alex x37v.alex@gmail.com)

2009-06-10 04:18  mrpeach

	* [r11735] Blob padding does not add zero if already modulo 4
	  length.
	  Blob length one also works.
	  Thanks Wolfgang Jäger for debugs...

2009-06-08 22:33  mrpeach

	* [r11720] Added blob type

2009-06-08 22:33  mrpeach

	* [r11719] Added a blob type, changed some post()s to error()s.

2009-05-10 19:42  mrpeach

	* [r11314] Fixed a bug where a type-forced message with a non-data
	  type following a type with an argument would cause an error.

2009-04-24 02:17  mrpeach

	* [r11107] removed unnecessary call to filelength.
	  added name of function in post()s to console.

2009-04-10 15:32  mrpeach

	* [r11003] Buffer must be less than or equal to argument,
	  not greater than.

2009-04-08 20:04  mrpeach

	* [r10989] This is an object that is supposed to output the
	  absolute path to the Pd external or abstraction named in its
	  argument or a message. Currently it works on linux but,
	  mysteriously, crashes Pd on WinXp.

2009-04-08 19:48  mrpeach

	* [r10988] Oops, I had forgotten to add the default timeout of
	  1000us.

2009-04-08 19:34  mrpeach

	* [r10987] Added timeout message to set send timeout in
	  microseconds, defaults to 1000.
	  Changed help patch to match.

2009-04-08 18:35  mrpeach

	* [r10986] Added [timeout( message to set microsecond timeout for
	  send. This gives time for unusually small buffers to clear.
	  Set default timeout to 1000us.
	  Also prints a message if the whole send didn't complete.
	  Updated help patch to match.

2009-03-09 16:01  mrpeach

	* [r10852] The 'sent' message now contains client number, bytes
	  sent, socket number. Empty 'send' message triggers list of client
	  messages on right outlet. Empty socket number message causes a
	  client message on right outlet.
	  Help patch updated.

2009-03-04 22:33  mrpeach

	* [r10835] Changed send routine to send one byte at a time and
	  output number of bytes sent, so it won't block if the other end
	  disappears. Also settable buffer size.
	  Help path updated.

2009-03-02 17:01  mrpeach

	* [r10828] Fixed a bug that prevented the send routine from leaving
	  the loop when no more data can be sent.
	  Now it won't hang if you try sending to a recently disconnected
	  client, honest!

2009-03-02 03:41  mrpeach

	* [r10827] tcpserver_send_buf: send only one byte at a time into
	  the buffer to avoid buffer overflow. This should not slow the
	  whole thing down too much since we're already passing things one
	  byte at a time.

2009-03-01 21:56  mrpeach

	* [r10824] Added a [clientbuf( message to set the send buffer size
	  for that client. Also the [client( message will output the
	  current buffer size as well as the socket and ip for that client.
	  Help patch updated.

2009-02-22 22:25  mrpeach

	* [r10804] Checks to see if a socket can be written to before
	  sending. If not, prints a message to the pd window and doesn't
	  send the data.

2009-02-03 14:05  mrpeach

	* [r10727] These were updated by roman
	  roman.haefeli@gmail.com
	  
	  [tcpsocket.OSC]
	  - fixed limitation of maximum size for incoming list for
	  serialization.
	  handles now arbitrary list lengths correctly.
	  
	  [tcpsocket.FUDI]
	  - fixed limitation of maximum size for incoming list for
	  serialization.
	  handles now arbitrary list lengths correctly.
	  - fixed delimiting problem: semicolons prepended by backslashes
	  are
	  correctly omitted for delimiter evaluation.

	  to first delimiter.

2009-01-28 21:42  mrpeach

	* [r10669] Added an outlet for the array size. The outlet is
	  updated with each incoming list or float. This makes it easier to
	  append to existing arrays.

2009-01-22 18:52  mrpeach

	* [r10598] flist2tab loads a list of floats into a table, resizing
	  the table if it is too small.

2009-01-22 18:51  mrpeach

	* [r10597] tab2flist extracts a list of floats from a table at a
	  given offset. The length of the list can be set via the second
	  inlet. Points outside the table are returned as zeros.

2009-01-13 14:03  mrpeach

	* [r10527] This is Roman Haefeli's tcpsocketserver for FUDI and
	  OSC.
	  Untested!

2008-11-21 22:11  mrpeach

	  depending on pd version.
	  (garray_getfloatwords was not implemented until pd 0.41)

	  list selector) as well.

2008-06-19 13:50  zmoelnig

	* [r10048] removed the svn:executable bit for code, patches and
	  text

2008-06-18 17:30  mrpeach

	* [r10030] Clarify what SO_REUSEADDR is for, no code changes.

2008-05-20 19:54  mrpeach

	* [r9861] Cleaned up and improved...

2008-05-20 19:53  mrpeach

	  server can close connections too.

2007-07-23 16:48  mrpeach

	  crashes when reinstantiating the object. Thanks IOhannes
	  for pointing it out!

2007-07-15 18:00  mrpeach

	* [r8082] Should compile on MSW now...

2007-07-12 15:25  mrpeach

	* [r8048] Now outputs negative delays on right outlet. Immediate
	  time tags will always output 0, "current" time tags will
	  always be slightly negative.

2007-07-12 15:22  mrpeach

	* [r8047] Reminder that opening a bundle sets the time tag at that
	  time.

2007-07-12 15:20  mrpeach

	* [r8027] Added handler for blob type.

2007-07-11 19:45  mrpeach

	* [r8022] Updated to use pipelist.

2007-07-11 19:44  mrpeach

	* [r8021] pipelist is like pipe for lists. It can be used with
	  unpackOSC to delay timetagged messages.

2007-07-11 17:34  mrpeach

	* [r8008] unpackOSC now simply outputs (through the right outlet) a
	  delay in milliseconds when it
	  receives a timetag, as the timetag itself is not useable inside
	  pd.
	  The delay is zero when the timetag is in the past.
	  Help patches have been updated to match.
	  Also corrected a mistake in packOSC.c timetag calculation.

2007-07-05 19:08  mrpeach

	* [r7901] Added some support for time tags: immediate or current

	  patched for string type.

2007-01-28 21:21  mrpeach

	* [r7390] An external that uses the string type. PD needs to be
	  patched for this...

2006-12-12 09:07  zmoelnig

	* [r6815] removed the "break;" statement in the broadcast() code to
	  enable broadcasting
	  to all connected clients (and not jsut the first one)
